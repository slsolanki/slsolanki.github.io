This is the GitHub account that I will use to take Waketech CCP courses. This repository will hold the assignments for my Web, Pgm, & Db Foundation course.

# About Me  
Hello! My name is Sanjana Solanki, and I am a **sophomore** at Panther Creek High School. I decided to take this course because I am interested in learning how to program and develop websites as both things have _many_ uses in various areas of study.  
I have an older sister and no pets, although I've always wanted a cat. My favorite color is orange, and my favorite season is winter because I love cold weather and snow, although North Carolina doesn't get much of it.
## My Interests:  
In my free time, I enjoy:
* Reading
 * In fiction, I enjoy adventure, science fiction, and mystery.
 * My favorite book is titled _Beyond the Bright Sea_ and it was a birthday gift from my mom.
 * In non-fiction, my favorite topics to read about are psychology and chemistry. 
* Music
 * I play two instruments: the oboe, which I play in concert band, and the flute, which I play in marching band. 
 * I also love listening to music.
 * A lot of the lessons I learn from music can be applied to other aspects of my life. My oboe private lessons teacher shared one of my favorite quotes with me: 
>_"What is often called exceptional ability is nothing more than persistant endeavor"_ -Pauli Murray
* Puzzles
 * This includes building with _LEGO_, doing jigsaw puzzles, and solving brain games.
 * Activities like these help me relax in a way that also keeps me engaged.
## My Recommended Websites:  
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) - YouTube is a very useful platform that can assist someone in many ways. I use it to find tutorials, help videos on subjects I don't understand, other learning, and entertainment. 
* [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/) - I use the graphing and scientific calculators on Desmos very often when a physical calculator is not available. It is incredibly easy to access and to use!
